# Data-Science-Capstone
Swaraj Rai's 2024-2025 Project to mark the completion of his Data Science Certificate at Wesleyan University
**Author**: Swaraj Rai

**Certificate**: Data Science Certificate, Wesleyan University (2024â€“2025)

**Project Title**: Beyond Capital: How Financial Inclusion, Governance, and Gender Gaps Shape Global Startups

**ðŸ§  Project Overview**
This capstone project explores the structural and socioeconomic drivers of entrepreneurial activity across nations. The analysis draws on global development indicators to model startup formation patterns, emphasizing three core levers:

1) Financial Inclusion (e.g., access to banking and digital payments)

2) Governance Quality (captured through World Governance Indicators)

3) Gender Gaps in Labor Participation (measured via the Women's Entrepreneurship Feasibility Score, or WEFS)

By integrating econometric modeling, clustering, and predictive analytics, the project identifies actionable insights for policy, investment, and international development.
