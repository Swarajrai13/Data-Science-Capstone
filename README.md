Project Title: Beyond Capital: How Financial Inclusion, Governance, and Gender Gaps Shape Global Startups

ðŸ§  Project Overview
This capstone project explores the structural and socioeconomic drivers of entrepreneurial activity across nations. The analysis draws on global development indicators to model startup formation patterns, emphasizing three core levers:

Financial Inclusion (e.g., access to banking and digital payments)

Governance Quality (captured through World Governance Indicators)

Gender Gaps in Labor Participation (measured via the Women's Entrepreneurship Feasibility Score, or WEFS)

By integrating econometric modeling, clustering, and predictive analytics, the project identifies actionable insights for policy, investment, and international development.

ðŸ’¡ Why This Topic?
"This work is deeply personal. I come from a long line of entrepreneurs â€” my grandmother, grandfather, and mother all built businesses in challenging settings. Their journeys, from the UAEâ€™s early growth stages to cross-border ventures across India, the UK, and the U.S., shaped my central question: Why do startups flourish in some nations and falter in others?"

This project is both an academic inquiry and a tribute to that legacy.

ðŸ“š Data Sources
World Bank Indicators (Findex, WGI, GDP, Education Spend)

Global Entrepreneurship Monitor (GEM)

Author-constructed WEFS Index (gender gap Ã— entrepreneurship Ã— informal economy weight)

ðŸ“Œ Future Directions
Incorporating longitudinal microdata

Interactive dashboard development (e.g., Shiny or Streamlit)

Collaboration with organizations driving women-led startups in emerging economies
